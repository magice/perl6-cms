# perl6-cms

## Preamble
This is, first and foremost, a personal experience on to perl6. This
repo is not meant to be released "as-is." If it is ever released, it
should be split into various components. It is done in such way merely
for me to not pay github too much :-).

## Over-goal
The goal is a cloud aware and optimized CMS.

## Structure
The repo is split into various components, each in its own directory.

Tracking of work is done on todo.org in base directory.
