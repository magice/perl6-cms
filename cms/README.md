content management and publication. This means that:

* Self-monitoring for such event
* P2P communications to coordinate
* Made of multiple interchangable parts, such that they can pluged and
out as demanded

Furthermore, CMS is also envisioned to be showcase of perl6 and AWS
capacities. As such, it:
* Natively multi-threaded
* Natively async with an eye on lowest possible latency
* Integrate with various AWS components
